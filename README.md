# Text-Editor


### User Story

As a user looking with a busy schedule, I would like an application that allows me to see, track, add, update, edit and delete my tasks. This will help me track and oraganize all my tasks. When I am on the homepage, I am presented with a toolbar where I can enter a new task. When I am looking at my existing tasks, I can see the To Do section, the In progress section and the completed section.
